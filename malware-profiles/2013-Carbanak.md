> Before creating the malicious service, Carbanak determines if either the avp.exe or avpui.exe processes (components of Kaspersky Internet Security) is running. If found on the target system, Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerabilityin Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, CVE-2013-3660, for localprivilege escalation.
> Carbanak injects its code into svchost.exe.
> Once the system is infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds. This monitoring is performed by intercepting the ResumeThread call.
