### Description

The Trickbot Group operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname, and primarily targeted victim computers belonging to businesses, entities, and individuals. Targets included hospitals, schools, public utilities, and governments.
Trickbot originates from the banking trojan Dyre used from 2014 to 2016 to perform man-in-the-browser attacks in order to steal the victim's banking credentials. Its focus, however, shifted to network penetration and installation of other malware. For this, dozens of modules applying various attack methods are available for download and use by Trickbot. See [^6] for an overview of known modules.
Trickbot is usually used in combination with the trojan Emotet and the ransomware Ryuk.
The victim's computer is firstly infected with Emotet through the Social Engineering method. See more in
 [`2014_emotet.md`](2014_emotet.md). Then the trojan Trickbot is installed on the victim's computer.
Trickbot is focused on penetration and distribution over the local network and especially over the authorization infrastructure. It sets itself up for a long term retention in order to get data about the victim’s systems, users and installed software. If the victim appears to be able to pay, the attackers use Trickbot to manually install the ransomware Ryuk. See more in [`2018_Ryuk.md`](2018_Ryuk.md).[^4]
