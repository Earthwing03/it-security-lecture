# :dart: Confidentiality

* **Protecting information from disclosure** to unauthorized parties
* Access to information should be granted only on a **need-to-know
  basis**
* **Data categorization** according to the amount and type of possible
  damage should it fall into wrong hands

#### Supporting Principles (:closed_lock_with_key:)

* Authentication, Authorization, Encryption, Anonymity, Secrecy

---

# :dart: Integrity

* **Protecting information from being modified** by unauthorized parties
* Being correct or **consistent with the intended state** of information
* Ensuring that the **information is not tampered** whenever it travels
  from source to destination or even stored at rest

#### Supporting Principles (:lock_with_ink_pen:)

* Hashing, Digital Signatures, Non-repudiation, Tamper-evident packaging

---

# :dart: Availability

* Ensuring that authorized parties are **able to access information**
  when needed
* Ensuring that the services of an organization are available

#### Supporting Principles (:atm:)

* Accessibility, Fault Tolerance, Redundancy, Backup, Testing

# Exercise 2.1 (:pushpin:)

1. Which security goals are at risk by the following threats?

| Threat                      | C  | I  | A  |
|:----------------------------|:---|:---|:---|
| Network Sniffing            |    |    |    |
| DDoS Attack                 |    |    |    |

|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| **Observing** | (:heavy_check_mark:) | :heavy_check_mark: |             Confidentiality              |

# Extended CIA Models

# [Parkerian Hexad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkerian_Hexad) (1998)

* Confidentiality
* Possession / Control (:new:)
* Integrity
* Authenticity (:new:)
* Availability
* Utility (:new:)

---

## :dart: Possession / Control

* Protecting against the idea that **confidential data can be
  possessed/controlled by an unauthorized individual or party**
* Loss of control or possession of information should not automatically
  lead to the breach of confidentiality

#### Supporting Principles (:left_luggage:)

* Encryption, Authentication

---

## :dart: Authenticity

* Assurance that **a message or transaction is from the source it claims
  to be from**

#### Supporting Principles (:memo:)

* Identification, Digital Certificates

:information_source: _Despite its close relation to Integrity you can
find Authenticity also used as part of an extended
[CIAA quartet](https://www.eosgmbh.de/en/protection-goals-cia-and-ciaa)
occasionally._

---

## :dart: Utility

* **Usefulness** of data or information

#### Supporting Principles (:floppy_disk::pager:)

* Compatibility, Accessibility

> Information may be available and therefore usable but it doesn't
> necessarily have to be in a useful form to be defined as available.

# Exercise 2.2 (:handshake:)

1. Which of the extended CIAA security goals could have been compromised
   in each of the
   [Motivation: Case Studies](01-01-motivation.md#case-studies)?
2. In your work group, research the assigned case and :heavy_check_mark:
   all compromised goals
3. Reason or prove each :heavy_check_mark: briefly during the
   presentation to the plenum

   goal, distinguishing between technical and organizational measures
