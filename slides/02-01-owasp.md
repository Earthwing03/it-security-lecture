# Exercise 1.1

## Install the OWASP Juice Shop `v12.x`

1. Install the latest
   [Node.js 14.x (or 12.x) release](https://nodejs.org/) on your

2. It is still recommended to make a backup of your progress regularly.
3. You can also use this `JSON` backup to restore your progress and
   settings on any other computer.
